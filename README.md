# Deep Hidden Physics Models reproduce by Paddle and PaddleScience

This project is a reproduction of DeepHPMS by paddle and paddlescience.

Formal codes of examples with PaddleScience will be merged in PaddleScience/examples/deephpms/(https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/PaddleScience), please see codes there.
